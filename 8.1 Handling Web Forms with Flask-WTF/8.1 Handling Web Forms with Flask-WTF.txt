overview of flask-wtf and form handling  
what is flask-wtf?  

flask-wtf is an extension for flask that simplifies the process of working with web forms in flask. it integrates flask with wtforms, a library that provides form-handling capabilities such as form validation, csrf protection, and rendering of forms

2. creating the flask web application  
step 1: setting up your flask project  

-> install flask and flask-wtf  
flask-wtf provides an easier way to handle forms in flask by integrating wtforms. before starting, you need to install both flask and flask-wtf  

pip install flask flask-wtf  

-> create your project folder  
organise your project with the following structure:  

flask_app/  
├── app.py          # main flask application code  
├── templates/      # folder to hold html templates  
│   └── index.html  # html form template  
└── static/         # folder to hold static files like css, javascript, and images  

step 2: create the flask application (app.py)  

from flask import flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session  
from flask_wtf import flaskform  
from wtforms import stringfield  
from wtforms.validators import datarequired  
import os  

# initialise the flask application  
app = flask(__name__)  

# set a secret key for session management and csrf protection  
app.config['secret_key'] = os.urandom(24)  

# define the form class using flask-wtf and wtforms  
class nameform(flaskform):  
    name = stringfield('what is your name?', validators=[datarequired()])  

# define the route for the index page (form submission)  
@app.route('/', methods=['get', 'post'])  
def index():  
    form = nameform()  

    if form.validate_on_submit():  
        # save the name to the session  
        session['name'] = form.name.data  
        # flash a success message  
        flash(f'welcome, {form.name.data}!', 'success')  
        # redirect to avoid form resubmission  
        return redirect(url_for('index'))  

    # render the template with form and any session data  
    return render_template('index.html', form=form, name=session.get('name'))  

# run the application  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run(debug=True)  

step 3: breakdown of the app.py file  

-> initialisation:  
    -> flask(__name__): creates a flask app instance. the __name__ argument tells flask where to find the templates and static files  
    -> secret_key: flask requires a secret key to securely sign the session cookie, which helps protect against csrf (cross-site request forgery) attacks  

-> form class (nameform):  
    -> nameform inherits from flaskform and uses stringfield to create a text input field for the user's name. the field uses the datarequired validator to ensure that the user inputs a name  

-> route (/):  
    -> this is the main route for the web page that displays the form. it listens for both get and post requests  
    -> form.validate_on_submit(): this checks whether the form was submitted and if the data is valid (in this case, checking if the name field is filled)  
    -> session['name'] = form.name.data: saves the submitted name into the user session to make it available in subsequent requests  
    -> flash(): adds a flash message that will be displayed after the form submission (in this case, a welcome message)  
    -> redirect(url_for('index')): redirects the user to the same page to avoid re-submission of the form data when they refresh the page  

step 4: creating the template (index.html)  

now, let's create the html template that will be used to render the form and show any flash messages. this file should be located inside the templates folder.  

<!doctype html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
    <meta charset="utf-8">  
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  
    <title>flask form with flash messages</title>  

    <!-- bootstrap css (for styling the form and flash messages) -->  
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">  

    <!-- custom css for the black background -->  
    <style>  
        body {  
            background-color: black;  
            color: white;  
            font-family: arial, sans-serif;  
        }  
        .container {  
            margin-top: 50px;  
        }  
        .alert {  
            color: white;  
        }  
    </style>  
</head>  
<body>  

<div class="container">  
    <h1 class="text-center">enter your name</h1>  

    <!-- flash messages display -->  
    {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %}  
        {% if messages %}  
            <div class="alert alert-{{ messages[0][0] }}">  
                {{ messages[0][1] }}  
            </div>  
        {% endif %}  
    {% endwith %}  

    <!-- form to input the name -->  
    <form method="post">  
        {{ form.hidden_tag() }}  <!-- csrf token -->  

        <div class="form-group">  
            {{ form.name.label(class="form-control-label") }}  
            {{ form.name(class="form-control") }}  <!-- input field -->  
        </div>  

        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-block">submit</button>  
    </form>  

    {% if name %}  
        <h2 class="text-center mt-4">hello, {{ name }}!</h2>  
    {% endif %}  
</div>  

<!-- bootstrap js (for any bootstrap-related functionalities) -->  
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>  
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.9.1/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>  
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  

</body>  
</html>  

step 5: breakdown of the index.html template  

-> basic html structure:  

    -> <!doctype html>: declares the document type as html5  
    -> <head>: contains metadata such as the character set, viewport settings, and the title of the web page  

-> css for styling:  
    -> the background-color: black makes the page background black, and color: white ensures the text is visible  
    -> the .container class adds some padding and margin to the form  

-> bootstrap integration:  
    -> the template uses bootstrap from a cdn for styling the form and flash messages  
    -> the form-control and btn btn-primary classes apply styling to the input field and submit button respectively  

-> flash messages:  
    -> get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true): this is a flask function that retrieves any messages that were flashed during the previous request. the with_categories=true option allows you to display messages with categories (e.g., 'success', 'error')  
    -> the alert-{{ messages[0][0] }} dynamically adds the correct bootstrap class for alert styles, depending on the message's category  

-> displaying the name:  
    -> if a name has been stored in the session, it is displayed below the form after submission  

-> form rendering:  
    -> {{ form.hidden_tag() }} generates a hidden csrf token field for the form to protect against csrf attacks  
    -> {{ form.name.label() }} and {{ form.name() }} generate the form’s label and input field respectively  

step 6: flash messages  
in flask, flash messages are temporary messages that can be shown to the user. when the form is successfully submitted, we use flash() to store a message in the session. these messages are then rendered in the template and displayed to the user  

    -> flash(f'welcome, {form.name.data}!', 'success'): the message is flashed with the category 'success'  
    -> get_flashed_messages(): retrieves the flashed messages from the session and makes them available to be rendered in the html template  

step 7: running the application  
-> run the flask app:  

python app.py  

-> open the browser:  
visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see your form in action  

3. how it works  
-> form submission (post request):  
    -> when the form is submitted, the post request is handled by the flask view function  
    -> the form is validated using flask-wtf's validate_on_submit() method. if the form is valid (i.e., the user has entered a name), the name field is saved to the session  

-> flash message and redirection:  
    -> a flash message is triggered to inform the user of successful form submission  
    -> the redirect(url_for('index')) is used to avoid double submissions when the page is refreshed  

-> session management:  
    -> the session allows the flask app to remember user data (e.g., name) between different requests  
    -> by using session['name'] = form.name.data, we save the name in the session, which can be accessed in subsequent requests
