-> making forms with flask-wtf lesson  
   -> exercise: create an interactive date of birth form  

-> introduction  
   -> by now, you should be familiar with defining, rendering, and adapting your view functions to work with forms and fields  
   -> in this exercise, you will apply your knowledge to create a new route in your flask application that displays a form asking for the user's date of birth  
   -> once the user submits the form, the web application will flash a message displaying their zodiac sign (e.g. libra, cancer) or their chinese zodiac animal (e.g. rat, ox)  

-> datefield  
   -> to accomplish this, you will use a field in your form that is specifically designed to accept dates  
   -> the datefield is like other fields in flask-wtf, in that it also accepts a label  
   -> you will need to ensure that the user cannot submit the form without entering a valid date  
   -> this is done by setting validation rules on the datefield to require a date entry  

-> view function  
   -> as you have learned, you will need a view function to handle the logic of the form  
   -> define your view function and make it the handler for the route `/zodiac`  
   -> in this view function, you will create an instance of the form  
   -> the function should check if the form has been submitted and is valid  
   -> when the form is successfully validated, you will redirect the user to the index page (`/`)  

-> template  
   -> create a new template file called `zodiac.html` to render the form  
   -> this template should inherit from the base template `base.html`  
   -> in `zodiac.html`, render the form created in the view function  
   -> the form should be the only thing displayed on the page, but you are encouraged to get creative and add additional styling or content if desired  

-> flash a message  
   -> after the user submits the form, you will want the web application to display a message indicating their zodiac sign or chinese zodiac animal  
   -> this can be done by using flask's `flash` function to display a message on the page  
   -> to calculate the user's zodiac sign or animal, you can use basic logic based on their birthdate  
   -> if you need help with this calculation or encounter any issues with the flask-wtf library, you can ask for help on the course's discord or consult your mentor  

-> have fun!  
   -> the most important part of this exercise is to have fun with it!  
   -> people tend to learn best when they enjoy what they're doing, so feel free to experiment and add personal touches to your form  
   -> don't worry too much about making it perfect'your preparing to dive into more advanced topics, like databases, in the next section  
   -> forms and database interaction are closely linked, as forms allow users to submit data that can then be stored in a database  

-> on mentorship 
   -> remember, you don't have to learn alone'there's support available through the codingnomads 1-on-1 mentorship program  
   -> by joining the programme, you will have access to:  
      -> a dedicated team of mentors and advisors who are committed to your success  
      -> weekly 1-on-1 screen share meetings with your personal, professional mentor  
      -> continuous, personalised support seven days a week via discord  
      -> accountability, feedback, encouragement, and guidance to help you succeed  

-> example routes and files  
   -> the route `/zodiac` will handle the display and submission of the form  
   -> your form will be rendered using the template `zodiac.html`, which inherits from `base.html`  
   -> you will use `datetime.date` from python's `datetime` module to handle and manipulate the user's birthdate  
   -> flash messages will be used to show the zodiac sign or chinese zodiac animal once the form has been submitted
