# CodingNomads-Flask-8-User-Profiles
## Repository File Tree
This repository contains my work for the 8th module in the [Coding Nomads Flask Web Framework](https://codingnomads.com/course/python-flask-web-framework) course. I completed this 21-module course as part of my independent learning, to invest in my Python skills. I produced an in-depth library of resources on this module, whose file tree is provided below.

## Library Contents
### Blue
I saved course material as pdf files (.pdf extensions) and made notes on these (Written Notes.txt). I made summary notes, by recording voice memos of Siri reading my written notes out (Voiced Notes.mp4a) and [created word clouds](https://wordart.com/create) out of these (Word Cloud.png). These word clouds were combined into a giff, to visually represent module content.

### Yellow
Video notes were made in a txt format, contained in [8.4 Videos](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-Flask-8-User-Profiles/tree/main/8.4%20Videos). A [module quiz](https://github.com/franpanteli/CodingNomads-Flask-8-User-Profiles/blob/main/8.3%20Quizzes/8.3%20Quiz%20Forms.pdf) was finally completed and passed.
